3. Configure server-side validation
4. Set up email delivery service

Example integration:
```javascript
// Replace the simulation in script.js
const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(formObject)
});
```
